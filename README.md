Personal portfolio for Code 301 - should be enhanced at the end of this class and throughout 401 (and later on...)
This portfolio is based on the Prologue template HTML5 template made by @ajlkn (aj@lkn.io). It currently displays a handful of the projects I've made in Code 201 and 301 so far, and will be periodically updated as we generate more content in class. Additionally, I've included my old honors thesis for something slightly more substantial.
